# Overview:

In this project, I will measure the current living room stats, including temperature and humidity, as well as the soil moisture of my lovely plant. I will be using the RPI Pico W as my microcontroller and setting up webhook messages to notify me when the soil moisture drops below 10 percent.
In addition to that, I have set up a water pump that can be controlled either through node-red ui or set up to work automatically when the moisture is bellow a certain point.

# Objective

The idea for this project came with the interest of solving a problem that I have during summer days, as I am usually away for a couple of weeks and my flower is left alone.
I wanted to create a system
