# Project Description:

In this project, I will measure the current living room stats, including temperature and humidity, as well as the soil moisture of my lovely plant. I will be using the RPI Pico W as my microcontroller and setting up webhook messages to notify me when the soil moisture drops below 10 percent. In addition to that, I have set up a water pump that can be controlled either through node-red ui or set up to work automatically when the moisture is bellow a certain point.
The amount of time it took me to complete this project was around 3 weeks as I had to wait for the parts to arrive and to test my code many times. If you have all the parts, the project can be finished in 6-8 hours.

# Objective

The idea for this project came with the interest of solving a problem that I have during summer days, as I am usually away for a couple of weeks and my flower is left alone.
I wanted to create a system where I can monitor the soil moisture and water the plant when needed, as well as monitor the temperature and humidity of the room. 

The main purpose when applied for the course is to learn how to use the microcontroller in order to create a system that can be used in real life. I always had a great interest in building a smart home system, and this is a great start for me to learn how to do it.

The insights that I gained from this project are that I can use the microcontroller to create a system that can be used in real life, and that I can use node-red to create a dashboard and control the system. I also learned how to set up webhook messages and how to use them to notify me when the soil moisture drops below a certain point.
